**AbfDB searches the filesystem for Axon Binary Format (ABF) files and stores their header information in a database.** ABF header information is read using the official ABFFIO.DLL (a 32-bit Windows binary) so this project is windows-only and must target x86 (see [AbfSharp](https://github.com/swharden/ABFsharp#dll-requirements) for details).
